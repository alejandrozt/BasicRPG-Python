# BasicRPG-Python
A basic RPG game
This currently includes:

- A random character generator in the form of "Name": ["Race", [strength, dexterity, constitution, inteligence, wisdom, charisma], ["Modifier1", "Modifier2", ...]]] (a nod to 5e)
- A random monster generator in the form of ["Name", maxHP, AC, Speed, {attack1, attack2, ...}]
- A random room generator, that creates a random HeightxWidth room, and fills it with furniture, treasure and monsters.

~ This also uses "names" by treyhunner for the "random" generation of first-names.
